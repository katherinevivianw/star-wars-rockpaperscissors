# star-wars-rockpaperscissors
A galactic twist on the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Set during the peak of The Clone Wars in a galaxy far, far away.
How the game works: 
1. Players represent the Galactic Republic, while the computer (randomized) represents the Separatists.
2. Players have three options on what force to deploy into battle. The Republic: clone army, Jedi Knight, Jedi Master. These choices are up against the computer's randomized deployment forces: droid ary, Sith apprentice, Sith Lord. 
3. In order to win the battle, players must win a majority of three deployment rounds. 

There are nine total different combos of plays. A hidden twist exists in the game: if a player chooses to deploy a clone army, and the computer randomly chooses to send a Sith Lord, Order 66 will commence. This leads to an immediate loss in the battle.
