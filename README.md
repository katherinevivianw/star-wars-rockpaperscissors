A galactic twist on the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Set during the peak of The Clone Wars in a galaxy far, far away.
How the game works: 
1. Players choose which side they want to play on: the Galactic Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems (the Separatists).
2. Players have three options on what force to deploy into battle. The Republic: clone army, Jedi Knight, Jedi Master The Separatists: droid army, Sith apprentice, Sith Master
There are nine total different combos of plays.
